I'm a third-year Ph.D candidate student from [School of Electronic Science and Engineering](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/). My research interests include vision-and-language navigation, multimodal fusion, embodied AI, causal learning, and trajectory-instruction generation. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qijun Chen](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/c/Chen:Qijun) of [Robotics and Artificial Intelligent Lab (RAIL)](https://rail.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm), Tongji University.
